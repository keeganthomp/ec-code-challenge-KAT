      <li>Create actions/handlers to remove events (hook up button)</li>
      <li>Create actions/handlers to move an event up or down the list (hook up those buttons)</li>
      <li>Make sort by venue name button work</li>
      <li>Add loader state in redux and show hide a loader based on that state (loader can be a static words Loading...)</li>
      <li>If the above was easy and you want to keep going, add a new route called /artist-info. It should take a route param called artistId. When that route loads it should get and display the artist info from the other endpoint found here, https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0 (to see how to setup childroutes with this setup look here, https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit). Add button on home page that will go to this route when there is an artist set.</li>
